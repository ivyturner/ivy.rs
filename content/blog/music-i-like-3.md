I’ve been slowly moving all of my music listening to my own collection, in order to finally move off of streaming services. I’ll write a post about that soon.

Anyway here’s a list of albums I’ve been liking. enjoy :)

## Lorde - Virgin (2025)

WE’RE SO FUCKING BACK.

I was going to write a blurb about this album but it’s grown to almost an entire blog post…
coming soon!

## Loyle Carner - hopefully ! (2025)

This album is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I still think his last album _hugo_ is better… but that might be just because that album was literally life-changing for me. Loyle also sings for the first time on this record, it’s nice :)

## Clipse - Let God Sort Em Out (2025)

HOLY SHIT. I haven’t listened to the full album yet (the last few weeks have been… overwhelming to say the least) but the tracks I have heard have brought me to my fucking knees.

Ace Trumpets has been on repeat in my head for weeks. The beat on So Be It is fucking haunting and I love it. I’m not even going to talk about Chains and Whips because this paragraph will be 3 days long.

## The stuff I don’t have much to say about

- KNEECAP - Fine Art (2024) - free palestine, fuck kier starmer
- Massive Attack - Safe From Harm (from Blue Lines, 1991) - this bass line is serious, infectious and dangerous
- Kendrick Lamar - GNX (2024) - top 3 album from last year
- yeule’s cover of Anthems For A Seventeen Year Old Girl from the I Saw The TV Glow soundtrack… god i need to talk about this movie
