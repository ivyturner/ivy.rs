### Design

ivy.rs is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), because I like how quick it is to make CSS do what I want.

The colorscheme in use is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), because It's Extremely Pretty.

The font is Inter, currently served by [Googl]

### the domains, [ivy], what do they MEAN?

i chose ivy.rs for three reasons
- short, easy to say
- i like the rust programming language, even if i am terrible at it
- my name is IVY RoSe

laker.tech is my old personal site domain and redirects here for posterity / so i don't have to update it.

ivy.rs is bought through [istanco.net](https://istanco.net) as Porkbun doesnt support .rs domains (yet?)
All of my other domains are bought through [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com).

DNS is hosted by [deSEC.io](https://desec.io) and controlled by [DNSControl](https://dnscontrol.org)
