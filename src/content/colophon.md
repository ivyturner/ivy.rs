ivy.rs is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and is hosted by [Love Computer](https://lovecomputer.net). (hire me ;D)

### Design

ivy.rs is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), because I like how quick it is to make CSS do what I want.

The colorscheme in use is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), because It's Extremely Pretty.

The fonts are IBM Plex {Sans,Mono}, served by [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net).

Icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and self-served by [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net).

### the domains, [ivy], what do they MEAN?

I chose ivy.rs for three reasons

- short, easy to say (i-vee dot r s)
- my name is IVY RoSe
- i like the rust programming language, even if i am terrible at it

ivy.rs is bought through [istanco.net](https://istanco.net) as Porkbun doesnt support .rs domains (yet?)
All of my other domains are bought through [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com).

DNS is hosted by [deSEC.io](https://desec.io) and controlled by [DNSControl](https://dnscontrol.org).
