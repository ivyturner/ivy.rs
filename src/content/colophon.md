ivy.rs is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and is deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io).

You can find the source code for this site on my git repo: [ivy/ivy.rs](https://git.houseplants.cloud/ivy/ivy.rs)

### Design

ivy.rs is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), because I like how quick it is to make CSS do what I want.

The colorscheme in use is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), because It's Extremely Pretty.

The fonts are IBM Plex {Sans,Mono}, served by [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net).

Icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and self-served by [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net).

### the domains, [ivy], what do they MEAN?

I chose ivy.rs for three reasons
- short, easy to say
- i like the rust programming language, even if i am terrible at it
- my name is IVY RoSe

laker.tech is my old personal site domain and redirects here for posterity / so I don't have to update it.

ivy.rs is bought through [istanco.net](https://istanco.net) as Porkbun doesnt support .rs domains (yet?)
All of my other domains are bought through [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com).

DNS is hosted by [deSEC.io](https://desec.io) and controlled by [DNSControl](https://dnscontrol.org).
