Hi! Welcome to my new website. We're on a version number high enough that I don't even care anymore.

It's been kind of an open secret that I've been working on this site for a bit, 
including [a blog post where i said i wasn't working on it](https://ivyneeds.rest/posts/this-might-not-be-my-home-but-its-a-start). 
But I did work on it. Because my brain is weird.

Plus because I've had this many iterations, I now finally have the stuff I wanted when I was making the first version of this site, such as:
- A working notes section (now just to make a good client for it that isnt [status.lol](https://status.lol))
- Auto-importing media tracking (letterboxd, last.fm[^1] so far)
- Secret date based things I won't talk about yet[^2]

It's not entirely finished though so expect a few more updates, soon[^3].

Also *Glacier* will stay active, on Pika cause I still like it.
