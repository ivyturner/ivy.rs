Hi! I'm Ivy and this is apparently my about page? 

I really don't warrant this, I'm boring and proud of it.

But if you really want to know stuff about me, alright here we go!

I was born on the 16th of October 2005 in [BLANK], UK, but I don't have anything interesting to say other than that's also Oscar Wilde's birthday. 

This may have been an omen to both my career and sexuality. 

I was diagnosed as Autistic in 2009 (age 4) and have been bounced around the local education system ever since. They're all dickheads. I will explain how, at a later date.

I'm currently still living in my hometown but I go to college a few miles away cause it's cute and all the other colleges I went to see were transphobic to me. Fun.

Oh yeah, I'm a transgender woman. I came out in 2022. It's one of the best decisions I ever made.
